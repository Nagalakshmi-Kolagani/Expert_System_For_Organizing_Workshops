# Expert_System_For_Organizing_Workshops

Project Description:

Module1: (USER MODULE) We should collect full information about workshops conducted, persons who knowns about the workshops, and where the persons work at, how the temperature is at the location, having known about the locations of the workshops conducted

Module2: (ORGANIZER MODULE) We should organize and conduct the workshops in such a way that no two workshops should be conducted nearby.

Module3: (REGISTRATION MODULE) We should Register all the participants with their information like Idno, name, email etc.



Project in Detail:

#Algorithm Used:

Forward Chaining or forward Reasoning is one of the two main methods of reasoning when using an inference engine. It is logically described logically as repeated application of modus ponens. Forward chaining is a popular implementation strategy for expert systems, business, and production rule systems

Forward chaining starts with the non-implications data and uses inference rules to obtain more data from an end user until a goal is reached. When a rule is found, the engine can conclude, or infer, the consequent, resulting in the addition of new information to its data. Finally, the inference engine knows about its environment.

There are five places where workshops are conducted. Every place has a different temperature.
Facts:

1.	Meghana lives in pune
2.	In Mumbai artificial intelligence workshop is conducted
3.	Vijayawada has hot temperature
4.	Nikhil’s place is immediately to the left of Renuka’s house
5.	Nikhila lives in a place where temperature is medium
6.	The person who works at zoho lives in a place where machine learning workshop is conducted
7.	Albert works at IBM
8.	The middle place is very cool
9.	Guntur is the first place
10.	IOT workshop is conducted where next to the place the person works at wipro
11.	In place next to the place where distributed computing workshop conducted they work at IBM
12.	The mam who works at google lives in a cool place
13.	The man who work in tata lives in Hyderabad
14.	Guntur is at a place where next to the place is lived by Jessy
15.	The temperature is very hot at place where next to the place the person works at wipro

#Algorithm used:

Backtracking is a general algorithm is a method for finding solutions to constraint satisfaction problems, which has constraints to be satisfied by the problem. For Example, graph coloring problem. We must color all the cities of the graph and coloring should be done in such a way that no two neighboring cities should have the same color. In this problem we use backtracking to check the color of previously colored city while coloring the present city.

Backtracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems, such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles. It is often the most convenient technique for parsing, for the knapsack problem and other combinatorial optimization problems

#Algorithm used:

Here I did not use any algorithm specifically, but I have use in built libraries like tkinter, sqlite3 

Programming Language used: Python:

Compilers that use for python are: Anaconda-Jupiter notebook, Colab online, Idle , Pycharm etc....
